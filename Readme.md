# Oscilloscope Recolourer
This is a free to use, open source project by Christo Kruger for recolouring black and white oscilloscope images into colour rich, nice to look at versions!

Feel free to add anything useful.

This recolourer does lack in the aspect that it only handles the "measure" menu. The colours used are all taken from already coloured images so the colours are accurate.

Note: If the tracelines of a voltage signal overlap the predrawn dots on a screenshot, the full line won't get coloured. I was too lazy to write a fancy algorithm so just edit them in paint or something. 
Feel free to commit a change if you write a function that circumvents this, or handles other menus.

## How to use
To use the recolourer, click on the coordinate buttons, and then on the line your like to recolour. If one of the channels isnt in use, toggle it to false next to the channel name on the left. You can also state which channel is being measured by toggling the buttons on the right hand side on the bottom. To change the colour of a line, just click on its name in the upper left hand corner. Finally, once your satisfied, click the save button.
