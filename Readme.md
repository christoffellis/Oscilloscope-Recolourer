## Oscilloscope Recolourer
This is a free to use, open source project by Christo Kruger for recolouring black and white oscilloscope images into colour rich, nice to look at versions!

Feel free to add anything useful.

This recolourer does lack in the aspect that it only handles the "measure" menu. The colours used are all taken from already coloured images so the colours are accurate.

Note: If the tracelines of a voltage signal overlap the predrawn dots on a screenshot, the full line won't get coloured. I was too lazy to write a fancy algorithm so just edit them in paint or something.
